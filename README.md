# *Drosophila* Connectome Analysis Toolkit (DROCAT) v4.5.0

DROCAT is a Python toolkit for analyzing and visualizing connectome data from **all NeuPrint databases and FlyWire datasets** — type-based pathfinding, interactive network visualizations with neurotransmitter grouping, 3D neuron morphology rendering, cross-dataset comparison, and EM↔LM driver line mapping (NeuronBridge). Everything is available both through a web UI and as standalone scripts.

> [!TIP]
> 🤖 **Agent-assisted:** ask your AI agent to run the bundled
> [`drocat-install`](skills/drocat-install/SKILL.md) skill — it installs all
> dependencies, configures tokens, verifies the installation, and launches
> the web UI for you. Installing the project also installs the analysis skills,
> so the agent already has them afterward (no fetch is needed):
> [`drocat-usage`](skills/drocat-usage/SKILL.md) for tab-matched script analyses
> (one recipe per UI tab), and [`drocat-backend`](skills/drocat-backend/SKILL.md)
> for flexible composition of backend modules. New to agents? Start with the
> [agent setup section](docs/INSTALLATION.md#5-agent-assisted-install--agent-setup).

## Quick Start

**Requirements:** conda (auto-installed if missing) and internet access on first run.

**Option 1 — One-click install & launch.** After cloning the repository, run the launcher:

| Platform | Command |
| --- | --- |
| macOS / Linux | `./run_DROCAT.command` (or double-click) |
| Windows | `run_DROCAT.bat` (or double-click) |

On first run it creates the versioned `drocat-4.5.0` Python 3.11 environment (via the bundled installer in `archive/install/`), installs the pinned dependencies, runs `pip check`, verifies the installation, and opens the web UI at **http://127.0.0.1:8080**. Later runs are self-healing: a missing or inconsistent environment is repaired automatically before starting. If the port is busy, the launcher offers a new one interactively.

**Option 2 — Agent-assisted install.** Copy the following prompt to your AI agent and let it finish cloning the repo, installing, verifying, and launching DROCAT:

> Fetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Swida-Alba/Drosophila-cross-dataset-connectome-analysis/v4.5.0/skills/drocat-install/SKILL.md and follow it to finish cloning the repo, installing, verifying, and launching DROCAT on this machine.

For script analysis without the UI, the agent uses the checked-in analysis skills
(with the UI closed): [`drocat-usage`](skills/drocat-usage/SKILL.md) for
one-tab analyses and [`drocat-backend`](skills/drocat-backend/SKILL.md) for
flexible backend composition. They are part of the repository, so an installed
agent has them — no fetch is required.

**Manual launch** (after installation) — double-click `run_DROCAT.command` (macOS / Linux) or `run_DROCAT.bat` (Windows), or from a terminal:

```bash
conda activate drocat-4.5.0 && python ui/app.py
```

Every UI panel links to its own instruction guide (see [docs/ui_guides/README.html](docs/ui_guides/README.html)).

## Supported Datasets

All NeuPrint server datasets are supported (verified against `api.neuprint.janelia.org`), plus the FlyWire/Codex datasets. NeuPrint datasets are fetched automatically; FlyWire datasets use local files (see the Settings tab).

<details>
<summary><b>NeuPrint (11 datasets)</b> — male-cns, hemibrain, optic-lobe, manc, fib19, mushroombody</summary>

| Dataset | Description (from NeuPrint server) |
| --- | --- |
| `male-cns:v1.0` | Complete MaleCNS connectome (Janelia FlyEM + Cambridge) — latest |
| `male-cns:v0.9` | Complete MaleCNS connectome |
| `hemibrain:v1.2.1` | Adult female brain reconstruction (central complex + surrounding neuropils) |
| `hemibrain:v1.1` | Older hemibrain release |
| `optic-lobe:v1.1` | Drosophila optic lobe (right lobe, ~50k neurons, subset of MaleCNS) |
| `optic-lobe:v1.0.1` | Fly optic lobe reconstruction (~50k neurons) |
| `manc:v1.2.3` | MANC connectome — latest |
| `manc:v1.2.1` | MANC connectome |
| `manc:v1.0` | MANC connectome (original) |
| `fib19:v1.0` | Partial reconstruction of the fly medulla / lobula / lobula plate |
| `mushroombody` | Fly alpha lobe in the mushroom body (983 neurons) |

</details>

### FlyWire / Codex (3, local files required)

| Dataset | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `flywire_FAFB_v783` | Female Adult Fly Brain (FAFB v783, 139,255 neurons) |
| `flywire_BANC_v888` | Brain and Nerve Cord (BANC v888, 158,262 neurons) |
| `flywire_BANC_v626` | Brain and Nerve Cord, older (BANC v626, 115,151 neurons) |

> BANC (Brain And Nerve Cord) is served via FlyWire/Codex as `flywire_BANC_v888` (local data files). The NeuPrint server metadata also lists a hidden `banc:v888` entry, but it is not queryable through the NeuPrint API and is therefore not supported.

## What's New in v4.5.0

- **Script-first analysis with coding agents** — run pathfinding, comparison, NeuronBridge, FlyLight, homolog, profile, PlotPath, and 3D skeleton scripts without the UI, via the [`drocat-usage`](skills/drocat-usage/SKILL.md) skill and its `run_direct.py` launcher.
- **Local FAFB/BANC dataset support** — local-first caching for 10-100x faster FlyWire access ([FAFB Integration](docs/FAFB_INTEGRATION.md)).
- **NT visualization & grouping** — neurotransmitter edge groups, custom groups, export/import ([Network Features](docs/visualizations/VisualizePath_Network_Features.md)).
- **Similar Neurons tab** — morphological (vector/NBLAST) and connection-profile similarity in one panel: multiple queries run independently, connectivity-expanded candidates read directly from the connection cache (top-N×3 similar *types* expanded to all their members), ROI filtering, intra-type reference data, dual result tables (bodyId-level `results.csv` + type-level `type_summary.csv`), and query-plus-top-N 3D skeleton visualizations. A full-morphology mode downloads every skeleton with a resumable progress/ETA pull and compares against the whole local population ([guide](docs/ui_guides/find_similar.html)).
- **Palette editor** — drag-and-drop reordering of discrete palette colors, a range slider applied directly to the displayed palette, a reset button beside the preview, and lateral range labels.
- **3D Skeleton reorganization** — independent card blocks for general appearance, neuron colors, synapse colors, and brain-region ROIs, with hemisphere-aware options.

📖 **[Full changelog](docs/README.md#recent-updates)** · **[Agent setup](docs/INSTALLATION.md#5-agent-assisted-install--agent-setup)** — including the low-cost DeepSeek (`deepseek-v4-flash`) Codex configuration
