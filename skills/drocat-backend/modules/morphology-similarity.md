# morphology — MorphologyComparer

Morphological similarity search (module `src/morphology.py`). The main class is
`MorphologyComparer` (query-vs-all similarity); `SkeletonVectorCache` manages the
skeleton vector cache used by morphological and `candidate_source` paths. BANC
datasets are not supported for morphology.

## MorphologyComparer — key params

```python
from morphology import MorphologyComparer

comparer = MorphologyComparer(
    query="aMe12",                      # str/int query (per query; loop for many)
    dataset="male-cns:v0.9",            # non-BANC only
    level="auto",                       # "auto" | "type" | "bodyid"
    method="vector_v2",                 # "vector_v2" | "nblast"
    metric="cosine",                    # vector similarity metric
    candidate_cap=500,                  # screen candidates entering comparison
    candidate_source="auto",            # "auto" | "roi" | "combined" | "profile" | "cache"
    visualize_top_n=0,                  # >0 to render top-N skeletons
    visualize_by="type",                # or "bodyId"
    min_weight=3,                       # connection-cache screen threshold
    min_shared_partners=2,
    roi_filter=None,                    # or ["EB", "LH", "AL"]
    output_dir="/abs/output/similar_morph",
    saveas="",
    verbose=True,
    n_workers=8,
    use_cache=True,
    cache_fetched_skeletons=True,       # persist raw skeletons
)

results = comparer.find_similar()       # -> pd.DataFrame
```

The two **size knobs** shared by every candidate-source mode are `candidate_cap`
(bounds how many screened candidates enter the comparison) and `visualize_top_n`
(bounds rendering only). Results are never truncated — every compared candidate is
returned and written.

### method="vector_v2" — spatial/topological comparison (default)

`vector_v2` is the DEFAULT and only vector method (the legacy global-shape
`"vector"` method was removed). It keeps the search pipeline (screening,
pooling, output) and pairs the vector schema with a block-weighted scorer.
The 256-dim V2 vector (cache schema v4) = the V1 124 dims + 8 **shape
extras** (`sx_*`: node-radius stats, sibling-edge branch angles at branch
points, cable-length fractions by Strahler order) + a **spatial block**
(12-dim arbor ellipsoid from node-coordinate PCA + 96-dim cable-mass
histogram over a population-fixed bounding box + 16-dim 1-D cable-mass
profiles: 8 radial bins from the arbor centroid and 8 midline-distance
bins). The former 24-dim Laplacian topology block was REMOVED in v4: its
eigensolver caused an intermittent vectorization cost lottery (median
0.3 s, tail to ~400 s/neuron) while its 10% weight measurably changed
nothing in the user-facing ranking (production-run analysis, l-LNv +
aMe12 2026-08-29: dropping it leaves top-10 type overlap 9-10/10,
Spearman >= 0.96). On NeuPrint datasets a 288-dim ROI-expansion block
(Hellinger pre/post fractions over the primary ROIs) is composed at runtime
and scored with weight `v2_roi_weight=0.2`; FAFB/FlyWire runs omit it.

Scoring is per-block cosine with weights `v2_block_weights` (default
shape 0.30 / spatial 0.70; effective .300/.700 after renormalization —
unbiased-sample sweep: spatial-heavy ratios beat balanced and
shape-heavy ones)
after **truncated ZCA whitening** of the standardized population:
whitening directions whose covariance eigenvalue is below 1% of the
largest is skipped (they carry only population noise — amplifying them
once collapsed every cosine toward 1), and the gain of kept directions is
capped (max 10x). The whitener is persisted beside the cache with a fit
version; identity below 64 rows. Block slices are clamped to the input
width, so V1-width snapshots (the warmed V1 counterpart cache) are scored
by their shape prefix.

**Spatial block**: right-hemisphere arbors are reflected onto the left at
vectorization time (lateral normalization, cache schema v2), so type-level
aggregation can no longer average L and R positions into a midline blur.
The spatial block score blends its cosine (50/50) with a **mass-overlap
term** — the min-sum intersection of the query's and the candidate's raw
Hellinger histograms — so a neuron with a proportionally similar but much
smaller overlap in the query's region scores lower.

**NBLAST (`method="nblast"`)**: NBLAST scores are computed BEFORE the type
aggregation, so `type_summary.csv` reflects NBLAST (the former flow
refined only the bodyId table, leaving the type list showing vector
scores). Candidates whose dotprops cannot be built keep their vector
prefilter score (same-type reference rows always do); when refinement is
skipped entirely the run logs a loud warning and records
`nblast_applied: false` in README.txt.

**Two-pass type reevaluation** (`expand_top_types=20`, `expand_per_type=10`,
`0` disables): after the first scoring pass, the remaining members of the
top-ranked candidate types join the pool (ROI-screen-ranked, up to
`expand_per_type` per type), are scored with the same
standardization/whitening, and the type aggregation re-runs. Type-level
scores are then coverage-weighted continuously: the type statistic (mean,
or max under `type_agg="max"`) is multiplied by `sqrt(type_coverage)`
(`similarity = similarity_raw * sqrt(coverage)`) — no thresholds, no
exclusion; sparse types are damped, fully covered types pass through
untouched. Columns `type_coverage`, `similarity_raw`, and `similarity_max`
document the treatment in type_summary.csv; the bodyId-level results.csv
carries `type_coverage` per row. Per-block score columns (`sim_shape`,
`sim_spatial`, `sim_roi`) are written to results.csv and
averaged into type_summary.csv.

**Connectivity-profile evidence backfill**: the `profile_similarity` column
is populated even when the ROI screen discovered the pool — first from the
shared-partner screen, then (v2) any remaining rows, including intra-type
query pairs, are scored with the Similarity>Connectivity machinery
(`ConnectivityProfiler` type profiles + `ProfileComparator.
weighted_cosine_similarity` on the shared local connection cache).

Caching: `SkeletonVectorCacheV2` shares the raw skeleton store with V1 but
keeps separate files (`find_similar/morphology/skeleton__vectors_v2.parquet`,
`meta_v2.json`, `whiten_v2.npy`), so V1 results are byte-for-byte unaffected.
V2 vectors use the **simp90 basis**: locally stored skeletons are re-leveled to
the canonical 90% level before vectorization, so the whole local population is
usable offline. The V1 counterpart cache stays warm during online fetches.
Block weights and basis are recorded in the run README.

```python
comparer = MorphologyComparer(
    query="aMe4", dataset="male-cns:v1.0", method="vector_v2",
    v2_block_weights={"shape": 0.3, "spatial": 0.7},
    v2_roi_weight=0.2,                  # 0 disables the ROI block
)
```

## SkeletonVectorCache

```python
from morphology import SkeletonVectorCache

cache = SkeletonVectorCache(dataset="male-cns:v0.9")
cache.build(fetch_missing=0)            # vectorize cached skeletons incrementally
cache.ensure(fetch_missing=0)           # build + load, ready to query
cache.coverage()                        # dict of coverage stats
vecs = cache.vectors_for(body_ids, compute_missing=True)
```

## Supporting functions

- `find_similar_raw_cache(dataset, ...)` — the raw skeleton cache helper.
- `find_similar_dataset_cache(dataset, ...)` — dataset-level cache helper.
- `find_similar_flywire_mesh_cache(...)` — FlyWire mesh cache helper.

## Notes

- `candidate_source` options are `["auto", "roi", "combined", "profile", "cache"]`;
  `"profile"`/`"combined"`/`"cache"` read the connection cache, `"roi"` uses ROI
  screening. Ensure cache coverage first (or set `cache_fetched_skeletons`).
- `visualize_top_n>0` triggers 3D rendering of the top matches — the UI feeds
  this through the shared skeleton settings.
- Multiple queries are a loop: one `MorphologyComparer` per query.
