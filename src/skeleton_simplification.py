"""In-memory topology-preserving TreeNeuron node simplification.

Render-time node reduction shared by the FAFB fast tube pipeline (25%
node retention) and the line-mode defaults (NeuPrint 50% reduction,
FAFB 90% reduction).  Simplification always operates on a copy so raw
SWC sources (healed ZIP, shared raw cache) stay canonical; nothing in
this module touches disk.

``navis.downsample_neuron`` has no target-node-count parameter, only a
factor.  The relationship between factor and retained nodes is monotonic,
so this module calibrates the factor with a short bracketed search until
the achieved count is close enough to the requested target.  Roots,
branch points and terminal nodes are preserved by navis, so very dense
neurons may keep more nodes than the nominal target — the reported
``achieved_nodes`` is authoritative.
